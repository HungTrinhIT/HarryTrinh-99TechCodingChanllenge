## ISSUE OF CURRENT COMPONENT (`MessyReact.tsx`)


1.  **Incorrect Filtering and Sorting Logic:**

    *   **`lhsPriority` Unused and `>` instead of `<`:** The `filter` logic checks `if (lhsPriority > -99)`, but `lhsPriority` is never defined within the `filter` callback. It's likely intended to be `balancePriority`.  Furthermore, the logic seems to be intended to *include* balances with a priority *greater* than -99 and a positive amount, so the comparison should be `> -99 && balance.amount > 0`. The original logic filters *out* valid balances.
    *   **Incomplete Sort:** The `sort` function doesn't return `0` when priorities are equal. This can lead to unstable sorting (the order of elements with equal priority might not be preserved).  A proper comparison function should return -1, 0, or 1.
    *   **Combined Filter and Sort:**  The `filter` and `sort` operations are combined within a single `useMemo`. While not strictly wrong, it's less readable and harder to reason about than separating these concerns.
    *   **Confusing return in filter**: `balance.amount <= 0` should `return false` to filter out.

2.  **Unnecessary `formattedBalances` Mapping:** The `formattedBalances` variable is created by mapping `sortedBalances` and adding a `formatted` property.  However, the `formatted` property is created using `balance.amount.toFixed()`, which defaults to zero decimal places.  This formatting is only used *within* the `WalletRow` component.  It's inefficient to pre-calculate this formatting for *all* balances if `WalletRow` could handle it directly.  This avoids an unnecessary iteration.

3.  **`prices` Dependency in `useMemo`:** The `useMemo` hook includes `prices` in its dependency array. This is potentially inefficient. If `prices` changes, but `balances` doesn't, the sorting and filtering will be recalculated unnecessarily.  The filtering and sorting logic *only* depends on the `balances` data. The price data is only used later, when rendering each row.  This is the most significant performance issue.

4.  **`index` as Key:** Using the `index` as a `key` in the `rows` mapping is an anti-pattern.  If the `sortedBalances` array changes order (which is the entire point of sorting!), React will have trouble efficiently updating the list, potentially leading to bugs or performance issues.  A unique and stable ID should be used as the key.  We'll assume that `balance.currency` is unique for this example.

5.  **`getPriority` Function Inside Component:** Defining `getPriority` inside the `WalletPage` component means it will be redefined on every render. While a small function, it's better practice to define utility functions outside the component to avoid unnecessary re-creations.

6.  **`any` type:** Using `any` for the `blockchain` type in `getPriority` disables type checking.  It's better to define a specific type for this.





## IMPROVEMENTS KEYS AND EXPLAINATIONS (`EnhancementReact.tsx`)

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1.  **Corrected Filtering and Sorting:**
    *   The `filter` condition is now `balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;`. This correctly includes balances with a priority greater than -99 *and* a positive amount.
    *   The `sort` function now correctly returns `-1`, `0`, or `1`, ensuring a stable sort.
    *   The filtering and sorting are done in separate `useMemo` hooks. This improves readability and, more importantly, allows React to cache the results of each operation independently.  The sorting `useMemo` now depends *only* on the `filteredBalances`, not on `prices`.
    *   A copy of `filteredBalances` is created using the spread operator (`...`) before sorting. This prevents the original `filteredBalances` array from being mutated, which is important for predictable behavior in React.

2.  **Removed `formattedBalances`:** The `formattedBalances` mapping (using `.map`) was removed.  The `formattedAmount` prop passed to `WalletRow` is now calculated directly within the `rows` mapping: `formattedAmount={balance.amount.toFixed()}`. This eliminates an unnecessary iteration over the `sortedBalances` array, improving performance.

3.  **`prices` Dependency Removed:** The `prices` dependency was removed from the `useMemo` hooks that calculate `filteredBalances` and `sortedBalances`.  These calculations only depend on the `balances` data.  The `prices` data is only needed when rendering each `WalletRow`, so it's used directly there. This prevents unnecessary recalculations of the filtering and sorting when the `prices` change but the `balances` do not.

4.  **`currency` as Key:** The `key` prop for each `WalletRow` is now `balance.currency`.  Using a unique and *stable* key is crucial for React's list rendering efficiency. We are *assuming* that `balance.currency` is unique; if it is not, a different unique identifier should be used.

5.  **`getPriority` Moved Outside:** The `getPriority` function was moved outside the `WalletPage` component. This prevents the function from being redefined on every render of the component, which is a minor performance optimization.

6.  **`Blockchain` Type:** A `type Blockchain = ...` was introduced. This provides type safety and autocompletion when working with blockchain values, preventing errors and making the code easier to understand.  It replaces the use of `any`, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript.

7.  **Simplified Props:** The `Props` interface of `WalletPage` was simplified. The spread operator (`...rest`) and the inherited `BoxProps` were removed, and the `children` prop was explicitly defined.  This makes the component's props clearer.

8.  **Simplified Object Creation:** In fitler function, removed spread operator.
